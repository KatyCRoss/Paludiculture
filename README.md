# Paludiculture
The dataset and R script associated with the Publication "Potential for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Savings from Paludiculture" part of the UK Governments Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Paludiculture Roadmap.

The dataset provides the background data and references which went into the report and all of the analysis and data visualisation was conducted using the uploaded R code.

The aim of this piece of work was to establish if any emissions savings could be achieved in Lowland Agricultural Peatlands in the UK by transitioning from cropland or grassland on peat to paludiculture. The full methods are discussed in the report.

The dataset contains any measurments of emissions from paludiculture crops on the UK live list until Nov 2024. The full description of the dataset can be found in the readme of the dataset.

The R script contains the code used to analyse the dataset.
